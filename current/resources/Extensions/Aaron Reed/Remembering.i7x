Version 9/140430 of Remembering by Aaron Reed begins here.

"Replaces 'You can't see any such thing' for a seen but out-of-scope noun with a message acknowledging that the parser recognizes the object. With Glulx, also keeps track of where the player last saw that object."

[Changelog:
 -- Version 9: Updated for latest build and made adaptive. 
 -- Version 8: Made reporting remembered locations into an activity.
 -- Version 7: updated rule names to be consistent
 -- Version 6: Added second example; Updated for Player Experience Upgrade compatibility; altered disambiguation rejection message to be more helpful; updated the default reference to a prior location to stop pretending it can generate natural-sounding English with the wide variety of possible room names; removed broken code trying to skip a disambiguation question. 
 -- Version 5: Included all grammar lines for examine, get, and drop. Understand "look for" or "find" something.
 -- Version 4: Updated to use no deprecated features
 -- Version 3: Updated for build 6859

Chapter - Remembering Main

Section - Grammar Line

[Future: any way to make this work for any reference to an object?]

Understand
"examine [any seen thing]" or
"x [any seen thing]" or
"look at/for [any seen thing]" or
"take [any seen thing]" or

Section - The Remembering Action

Remembering is an action applying to one thing.

The allow remembering faraway things rule is listed instead of the basic accessibility rule in the action-processing rules.

This is the allow remembering faraway things rule:
	unless remembering, abide by the basic accessibility rule.

Report remembering (this is the Remembering generic report remembering rule): say "[as the parser][We] [can't see] [the noun] any more.[as normal][line break]" (A).

Chapter - Fixes

Section - Fix in this context message

[ Since we've used an "any" grammar token, we'll get the "That noun did not make sense in that context." message for any unrecognized word or not visible noun. Restore this to the normal behavior. Note: if your game features other uses of "any" tokens, you'll need to replace this rule. ]

Rule for printing a parser error when the latest parser error is the noun did not make sense in that context error (this is the Remembering replace did not make sense in that context rule):
	now the latest parser error is the can't see any such thing error;
	make no decision.

Section - Avoiding Disambiguation

 [In practice, it doesn't really matter which of several unavailable items the player was referring to; it's quite annoying to be asked which one you meant and then told it isn't there anyway. Unfortunately, there's no easy way to bypass the disambiguation process since it's hard-coded into the Inform 6 templates. Here we do a trick, simply printing a refusal message instead of the disambiguation question. This mostly works, EXCEPT if the player tries to type a direction word: since directions aren't understood as verbs, the parser tries to insert the command into the misunderstood line, leading to "You can't see any such thing."]

Rule for asking which do you mean while remembering (this is the Remembering don't disambiguate while remembering rule): say "[as the parser]That's not something [we] [can see].[as normal][line break]" (A).

Chapter - Keeping Track (for Glulx only)

Section - The Remembered Location

Every thing has an object called the remembered location. The remembered location of a thing is usually nothing.

Section - Rules

Last when play begins (this is the Remembering update remembered positions for first turn rule):
	follow the Remembering update remembered positions of things rule.

Every turn (this is the Remembering update remembered positions of things rule):
	unless in darkness:
		repeat with item running through things that are enclosed by the location:
			if remembered location of item is not holder of item:
				if item is visible:
					now the remembered location of item is the holder of item.

First report remembering (this is the Remembering specific report remembering rule):
	if remembered location of noun is nothing, continue the action;
	say "[as the parser]The last time [we] [saw] [the noun], [they] [was-were of noun] [at the remembered location of noun].[as normal][line break]" (A);
	stop the action. 

To decide whether (item - an object) acts plural: 
	if the item is plural-named or the item is ambiguously plural:
		yes;
	no.

To say saw:
	if the story tense is future tense:
		say "will have seen";
	else:
		say "saw".

To say was-were of (N - an object):
	if the story tense is future tense:
		say "will have been";
	otherwise if N acts plural:
		say "were";
	otherwise:
		say "was".

To say at the (place - an object):
	carry out the saying the location name activity with place.
		

Section - The Activity
	
saying the location name of something is an activity on objects.

For saying the location name of a room (called place) (this is the Remembering saying room name rule): say "at '[the place]'" (A).

For saying the location name of the location (this is the Remembering saying current location name rule): say "right here" (A).

For saying the location name of a person (called subject) (this is the Remembering saying person name rule): say "in the possession of [the subject]" (A).

For saying the location name of a person who is the player (this is the Remembering saying player name rule): say "in your possession" (A).

For saying the location name of a container (called the holder) (this is the Remembering saying container name rule): say "in [the holder]" (A).

For saying the location name of a supporter (called the holder) (this is the Remembering saying supporter name rule): say "on [the holder]" (A).


Remembering ends here.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

The parser message "You can't see any such thing." is used both when the player types a noun the game does not understand, and when he types one that is not currently visible. This extension replaces the message in the latter case (if the player knows about the object in question) with a message acknowledging that the game knows that object exists. In Glulx games, the extension also tracks where each object was last seen and shares that info with the player.

We do this with a new internal verb, "to remember," which is triggered by any attempt to examine, take, or drop a "seen" but not visible noun. ("Seen" is defined in the required Epistemology by Eric Eve extension.) 

Disambiguation questions during remembering are usually fairly pointless, since the command isn't going to succeed anyway. We replace them with a generic "You can't see that" style message that doesn't reference a specific noun. If you *do* want to ask disambiguation questions while remembering, add the following line to your code:

	The Remembering don't disambiguate while remembering rule is not listed in any rulebook.

In Glulx games, the message additionally reports the last thing the player witnessed enclosing the item, be it a room, supporter/container, or person. To describe the parent of the remembered item, a new activity is provided called "saying the location name of something". Rooms, for instance, are by default described like "at 'Stage'" (since it's difficult to know whether authors have given their rooms names that will make sense in a natural-language sentence). You can override this for specific rooms by creating a more specific rule:

	For saying the location name of Stage: say "on the main stage".
	
You could also (for instance) make rules to describe items remembered to be in the possession of certain groups of people:

	For saying the location name of a person who is a thief (called the villain): say "pilfered by [the villain]".
	
(See the Rules tab of the Index pane or the final section of the extension itself for a list of the built-in rules.)

All these and the other responses generated by the extension can be seen with the RESPONSES testing command, and modified by giving them a new value. For instance, to change the way an item remembered to be in a room is reported:
	
	The Remembering saying room name rule response (A) is "in the area known as [the place]".

Note: this functionality should work for most games, but assumes that the player character does not change, that time is sequential over the course of the game, and that the player does not observe objects moving in unusual ways (such as during a cut scene). If any of these assumptions are incorrect for your game, you'll need to replace or adjust this chapter.

A final note: if your game makes use of "any" tokens in your Understand lines, you may want to replace the "Remembering replace did not make sense in that context" rule with one that works for your game. (This rule ensures that the "You can't see any such thing" message is still printed for unrecognized words, or nouns which haven't been encountered yet.)
