			<p>This is a public library of extensions shared by Inform authors. They're all published under a
			Creative Commons Attribution licence, which means you can use them for free in any project of your own.
			(Inform will automatically take care of crediting the authors.)</p>
			<p>This version of the library was intended for users of Inform version 9.1
			('6L02'), 9.2 ('6L38') or 9.3 ('6M62'). If you have updated to version 10,
			you may need newer versions of some of these extensions:
			<a href='https://github.com/i7/extensions'>this is a good place to look
			for those</a>. At some point we hope to replace this form of the library with
			a more version-aware one, able to install multiple versions as needed.
			In the mean time, if you need a different version of an extension just
			for one project, you can install it in that project's X.materials/Extensions
			directory. Or if you need to uninstall a version of an extension you've
			installed with the buttons below, your app should provide a menu item
			to bring up the directory in your file-system Finder or Explorer.</p>
			<p>You can review or discuss extensions (other than the built-in ones) at the
			Interactive Fiction Forum using the links provided. If you'd like to suggest future
			extensions, or talk about general questions to do with extensions, please
			<a href='http://www.intfiction.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=45&t=13409'>click here instead<a>
			to get to the topic provided for that.</p>
