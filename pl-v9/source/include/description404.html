			<p>This tab normally holds a public library of extensions shared by
			Inform authors, but right now it's <b>disconnected</b>.</p>
			<p>It's possible that the Inform website is down, and if so then our
			apologies: please try again later.</p>
			<p>It's possible that your computer is not currently connected to the
			Internet, and if so, please try again when you're back online.</p>
			<p>Though this is less likely, it's also possible that you're behind
			a firewall which is for some reason blocking the traffic. But since
			Inform is only making a regular Internet connection, not using an
			unusual port, it's more likely to be for one of the reasons above.</p>
