Version 9/140501 of Keyword Interface by Aaron Reed begins here.

"This extension emulates Blue Lacuna's emphasized keyword system for simplifying common IF input. Nouns, directions, and topics can be typed without a verb to examine, go, or discuss. Works with Glulx or z-code."

[Changelog:
  -- Version 9: Updated for latest build and to be adaptive.
  -- Version 8: Updated for compatibility with Neutral Library Messages and Player Experience Upgrade
  -- Version 7: Updated for build 6F95; simplified method for setting default state of different keyword types without needing a "when play begins" rule; expanded American Dialect checks to cover all default message appearances of "emphasize," "recognize," and "color" and their variants; changed "things" command to omit items carried by the player; fixed a bug with a post-keyword setting "look" not happening in games without required keywords; many changes to the documentation to make it more accurate and clear.
  -- Version 6: Now emphasizes objects listed after opening an opaque container; omit release number in welcome message if it is not set.
  -- Version 5: Updated to use no deprecated features
  -- Version 4: Updated for build 6859
  -- Version 3: Allowed scenery to be highlighted by default.
  -- Version 2: fixed a namespace issue (output --> KI output)
]

[Possible future improvements:
 -- Add Blue Lacuna's ability to assume the last noun if a verb is typed alone.
 -- Add Walker & Silhouette's ability to take sensible actions after examine: so BOX the first time might examine it, then BOX the next time would open it.
 -- Add ALL CAPS as another emphasis style.

Chapter - Setup

Keywords required is initially false.


Chapter - Things

Section - Examine Grammar Line

Understand "[a thing]" as examining.

Section - Definitions

Object keyword highlighting is initially true. [Global activation of object keywords.]

Every thing has a text called the keyword. The keyword of a thing is usually "". [which word of a multi-word noun should be highlighted. In practice, the player can type any word with the same effect, but for presentation purposes it's best to have a single word highlighted.]

A thing is either keyworded or keywordless. A thing is usually keyworded. Scenery is usually keywordless. [Only keyworded things are not automatically highlighted in room descriptions.]

Object keywording something is an activity on objects.

Rule for printing the name of a thing (called item) while looking (this is the Keyword Interface highlight objects when looking rule):
	carry out the object keywording activity with item.

Rule for printing the name of a thing (called item) while taking inventory (this is the Keyword Interface highlight objects when taking inventory rule):
	carry out the object keywording activity with item.

Rule for printing the name of a thing (called item) while opening (this is the Keyword Interface highlight objects when opening rule):
	carry out the object keywording activity with item.
		

Section - Rule for object keywording something

Rule for object keywording something (called item) (this is the Keyword Interface object keywording rule):
	if object keyword highlighting is false or item is keywordless:
		say the printed name of item;
		continue the action;
	let output be indexed text;
	now output is the printed name of item;
	let kw be indexed text;
	now kw is the keyword of item;
	if kw is "", now kw is word number ( the number of words in output ) in output;
	repeat with wordcounter running from 1 to the number of words in output:
		say "[if wordcounter > 1] [end if]";
		if word number wordcounter in output matches the regular expression "\b(?i)[kw]":
			say "[o][word number wordcounter in output][x]";
		else:
			say "[word number wordcounter in output]".


Chapter - Exits

Section - Definitions

Direction keyword highlighting is initially true.

Understand "[a direction]" as going. Understand "[an open door]" as entering.

Direction keywording something is an activity. 

Rule for printing the name of a direction (called dir) while looking (this is the Keyword Interface highlight directions while looking rule):
	carry out the direction keywording activity with dir.

Rule for printing the name of a direction (called dir) while listing exits (this is the Keyword Interface highlight directions while listing exits rule):
	carry out the direction keywording activity with dir.

Section - Rule for direction keywording something

Rule for direction keywording a direction (called dir) (this is the Keyword Interface direction keywording rule):
	if direction keyword highlighting is false:
		say the printed name of dir;
		continue the action;
	say "[d][the printed name of dir][x]".


Chapter - Topics

Topic keyword highlighting is initially false.

	reset styles with the style of parser-word.


Chapter - Don't auto-convert parser messages (For use without Neutral Library Messages by Aaron Reed)

Section - Don't auto-convert parser messages (For use without Player Experience Upgrade by Aaron Reed)

Before printing a parser error when parser highlighting is true (this is the Keyword Interface before printing a parser error rule):
	say "[as the parser]".

After printing a parser error when parser highlighting is true (this is the Keyword Interface after printing a parser error rule):
	say "[as normal]". 


Chapter - Keyword Types

A keyword type is a kind of thing. object-word is a keyword type. direction-word is a keyword type. topic-word is a keyword type. parser-word is a keyword type.

A keyword emphasis is a kind of value. The plural of keyword emphasis is keyword emphases. 

A keyword type has a keyword emphasis called style. 

The active style is a keyword emphasis that varies. 

we-are-parser-speaking is initially false.  [It's possible to have, say, an emphasized object keyword within a parser error message; this variable keeps track of whether we need to return to the parser style after switching off another keyword style.]
	
To say o:
	if object keyword highlighting is true:
		set the text style for the style of object-word; 
		now the active style is the style of object-word.

Chapter - Screen Reader Mode

[Screen reader mode does not have much effect by itself; it's mainly provided as a hook for authors with games containing other visual-oriented features. For instance, Blue Lacuna's backwards messages are described in prose rather than presented literally if screen reader mode is true.]

Screen reader mode is a truth state that varies. 

Setting screen reader mode is an action out of world. Understand "screenreader" or "screen reader" as setting screen reader mode.

If it doesn't, you can type [o]things[x] from any prompt for a list of nearby objects, or type [d]exits[x] for a list of nearby directions. Type [o]keywords[x] to adjust the style of keywords, or type screen reader with no space to toggle this mode on or off." (B).

Section - Exits

[This routine is lifted straight from the example in the Inform 7 docs.]

Understand "exits" as listing exits. Listing exits is an action out of world applying to nothing.

Definition: a direction (called thataway) is viable if the room thataway from the location is a room.

Carry out listing exits (this is the Keyword Interface carry out listing exits rule):
	let count of exits be the number of viable directions; 
	if the count of exits is 0, say "[It] [seem] there [are] nowhere to go." (A);

Section - Things

Understand "things" as thing listing. Thing listing is an action out of world applying to nothing.

Carry out thing listing (this is the Keyword Interface carry out thing listing rule):
	say "Nearby [is-are a list of visible other things which are not carried by the player][if the number of visible other things which are not carried by the player is 0] of note[end if]." (A)

Definition: a thing is other if it is not the player.

[Acknowledge that the player may be trying to type a keyword, not just a verb.]


Chapter - Messages

Section - Keyword Introduction Text

Showing the keyword introduction text is an activity.

For showing the keyword introduction text (this is the Keyword Interface showing the keyword introduction text rule):
	say "As you read [story title], you'll see certain [emphasiz]ed keywords in the prose. Type any keyword to advance the story. [if object keyword highlighting is true]You can type an [emphasiz]ed [o]object[x] keyword to examine that item more closely. [end if][if direction keyword highlighting is true]An [emphasiz]ed [d]direction[x] indicates that typing that word will move you that direction or towards that distant scenery. [end if][if topic keyword highlighting is true]An [emphasiz]ed word in [t]conversation[x] means typing that word will steer the conversation towards that topic. [end if][paragraph break]If the keyword[if the number of active keyword systems > 1]s in the paragraph above are[else] in the paragraph above is[end if] not distinct from the surrounding text, type KEYWORDS to adjust the display style." (A)

[This extension uses a statistically unlikely number of words with spellings that differ in America. We define a number of text substitutions to let us easily switch between.]

To say emphasiz: if the American dialect option is active, say "emphasiz"; else say "emphasis". To say Emphasiz: if the American dialect option is active, say "Emphasiz"; else say "Emphasis".

To say color: if the American dialect option is active, say "color"; else say "colour". To say Color: if the American dialect option is active, say "Color"; else say "Colour".

To say recogniz: if the American dialect option is active, say "recogniz"; else say "recognis". To say Recogniz: if the American dialect option is active, say "Recogniz"; else say "Recognis".

To decide what number is the number of active keyword systems:
	let ctr be 0;
	if object keyword highlighting is true, increase ctr by 1;
	if direction keyword highlighting is true, increase ctr by 1;
	if topic keyword highlighting is true, increase ctr by 1;
	decide on ctr.


Keyword Interface ends here.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

This extension emulates the emphasized keyword system for streamlining common IF input, as seen in "Blue Lacuna." Nouns, directions, and topics are highlighted and can be typed without verbs to examine, move, or discuss, respectively. (Topics are implemented only in skeletal form to allow for integration with any conversation system; Keywords for Conversation by Matt Wigdahl, for instance, will integrate it with Eric Eve's Conversation Package extensions.) A full system for letting the player select his own preferred color scheme and keeping games backwards-compatible for players on screen readers or with no color support is also included. The extension is compatible with either z-code or Glulx.

A warning: Inform authors using color have poor options on either platform. In z-code games, colors can be freely adjusted, but are limited to a palette of eight neon shades, only a few of which will be readable on any given backdrop. Glulx users can select from a palette of sixteen million colors, but can only make two of these available at a time, and these cannot be changed during play. On z-code, all eight colors are made available to the user and can be adjusted by player or author at any time; on Glulx, the two defaults are blue and green, and only authors can customize this. On both platforms, bold, italics, and fixed-width are offered as alternatives to colored keywords.

Section: Basic Usage

Keyword Interface allows an emphasis style to be set for one of four possible categories. Each of these can be enabled or disabled independently by the author or player. By default, they are set as follows:

	Object keyword highlighting is initially true.
	Direction keyword highlighting is initially true.
	Topic keyword highlighting is initially false.
	Parser highlighting is initially false.

These can be enabled or disabled at any time during play through a "now" statement, or globally by making a more definitive assertion:

	Object keyword highlighting is false.

If keywords are a crucial component of your game, you can add the following:

	Keywords required is true.

This will bring up a message before your game begins ensuring that players can see the keyword highlighting, and giving them an option to adjust styles. Alternatively, you can advertize the KEYWORD verb to players, which brings up the same menu, or show some stock explanatory text, customized to which keywords are enabled, by using the following phrase, perhaps in the carry out rule for an "about" command:

	carry out the showing the keyword introduction text activity

Section: Objects

When object keyword highlighting is set to true, the extension will automatically emphasize non-scenery objects listed by the parser. Objects in descriptive text may be manually emphasized by wrapping them in [o] and [x] substitutions.

	The Office is a room. "Only a bare [o]bulb[x] illuminates this dim office, empty except for a solitary desk.". A desk and a bare bulb are scenery in the office. On the desk is a telephone book and the lamp.

This produces output like the following (where emphasis is marked with asterisks):

	The Office
	Only a bare *bulb* illuminates this dim office, empty except for a solitary desk.

	On the desk are a telephone *book* and a *lamp*.

If you want scenery items to be automatically emphasized, you can manually set them as keyworded, or include a line like the following (which would add emphasis to "desk" in the final line above):

	When play begins: now every scenery thing is keyworded.

The emphasized word will be the final word of the object's printed name. To change this, you can use the object's "keyword" text property, which should be one of the other words in the printed name. You can also define an object as "keywordless," in which case it will never be automatically emphasized.

	A book of memories with keyword "book" is in the Office. Some scattered cigarettes are a keywordless thing in the Office.

Produces:

	"You can also see a *book* of memories and some scattered cigarettes here."

Automatic emphasis normally occurs when looking, opening or taking inventory. If you want to disable one of these you can use code like the following:

	The Keyword Interface highlight objects when looking rule is not listed in any rulebook.

Conversely, if you want object highlighting during other times, you can use code like this:
	
	Rule for printing the name of a thing (called item) while asking which do you mean:
		carry out the object keywording activity with item.

Section: Directions

When direction keyword highlighting is set to true and cardinal directions are wrapped in brackets in room descriptions, these will be emphasized as they are printed.

	"Gloomy passages depart to the [south] and [east]."

Compassless navigation as seen in Blue Lacuna can be implemented by adding a directional keyword as a synonym for the intended direction, limiting this to the specific room in which that keyword is valid, and wrapping the relevant word in "d" and "x" tags in the descriptive text.

	"Gloomy passages depart down a dusty set of [d]stairs[x] and through a wide [d]passage[x]." Understand "stairs" as south when location is Gloomy Tunnel. Understand "passage" as east when location is Gloomy Tunnel.

An "exits" verb is included with Keyword Interface to assist blind users or those without color interpreters (who in the above example would have no way of knowing which words correspond to movement). EXITS lists all of the cardinal exits from the current location. If your game uses compassless navigation, you may want to extend this verb to print your keywords instead (see the "Gnome's Holiday" example below for one way to do this).

Section: Topics

Since there are so many different conversation systems, support for highlighting conversation topics is only vestigial. It's turned on when "topic keyword highlighting" is set to true and you can invoke it with the "[t]topic[x]" wrapper, but everything else will have to be done by hand to match your own conversation system. Again, see "Gnome's Holiday" for a simple example of a keyword-based conversation system.

Section: Parser Messages

The extension can also style parser messages differently from normal game text. This may be useful to authors who wish to differentiate error messages ("I didn't understand the first part of that.") from in-game admonishments ("You wouldn't be caught dead wearing that.")

Parser error highlighting is disabled by default; you can turn it on with

	Parser highlighting is true.

If your game defines new parser error messages or rewrites existing ones, you should wrap them in the "as the parser" and "as normal" say statements:

	Understand "floop" as a mistake ("[as the parser]To cast a spell, you must cast it on something, like FLOOP THE MATTRESS.[as normal]").

Section: Control

To change the default color values at the start of play, authors can use syntax like:

	The style of object-word is keyword-cyan.

The four modes are object-word, direction-word, topic-word, and parser-word. For Glulx games, possible styles are keyword-color1-style and keyword-color2-style; for z-code games, they are keyword-red, keyword-green, keyword-yellow, keyword-blue, keyword-magenta, keyword-cyan, keyword-white, and keyword-black. Both VMs provide the additional styles keyword-bold-style, keyword-italics-style, keyword-fixedwidth-style, and keyword-no-style.

To change the Glulx colors, you can adjust g-color1 and g-color2 by amending the Table of Common Color Values-- see the documentation for "Glulx Text Effects" by Emily Short for more information.

	Table of Common Color Values (amended)
	glulx color value	assigned number   
	g-color1	15645627

All messages the extension prints are customizable responses. Use the RESPONSES testing command to view them, then adjust with a line like the following:
	
	The setup keyword emphasis rule response (B) is "This is what [o]objects[x] look like."

Section: Screen Reader Mode

By typing "screen reader" or selecting the appropriate option from the keyword customization menu, players can set the internal variable "screen reader mode" to true. Blind players and those without color interpreters can activate this mode. This might be useful to provide an alternative if your game contains other visual components such as a map, or uses color in puzzles.

The extension provides two verbs to assist color-challenged players: a "things" command which prints a list of nearby objects, and an "exits" command which summarizes the nearby directions. If you're using compassless navigation, you may want to customize the exits command to make use of your custom direction names. Additionally, if your game features conversation, strongly consider building a "topics" command to round out the set.


Section: Disambiguation

Inform's normal disambiguation assumes that every command begins with a verb, which means conflicts between keywords, and between keywords and verbs, are hard or impossible to control. The best solution is to make sure your object, direction, and topic keywords have no overlap.

*If an object and direction keyword* are in the same scope, the parser silently assumes the player means the direction keyword, and will print a seemingly useless "(the object)" clarification if the player manually examines that object instead.

*If a highlighted keyword matches a verb*, the verb will take precedence. For example, typing "set" to reference a chess set would instead produce the message "What do you want to set?" The best way to avoid this is to change the keyword and description of the object to avoid mentioning the verb word-- in this case "chessboard" might be a good substitute. You could also disable the verb if it's not one your story uses (see "Overriding existing commands" in the docs).

*Conversation systems should take precedence over objects* since this is what players will expect. See the example below for one implementation of this.


Example: * Sense of Direction - A simple usage of the extension to print bold compass directions.

The flexibility of Keyword Interface means it can be used for multiple purposes. Here we strip away and focus some of its functionality to simply print compass directions in bold.

	*: "Sense of Direction"

	Include Keyword Interface by Aaron Reed.

	Object keyword highlighting is false. The style of direction-word is keyword-bold-style.

	After looking: try listing exits.

Example: ** The Gnome's Holiday - A full example of emphasized objects, compassless directions, and conversation topics.

We'll create a slightly longer scenario with several locations and a simple puzzle, to demonstrate the full potential of Keyword Interface. This story has "keywords required" set to true, so it begins with a menu that helps players calibrate keywords.

We implement an extremely simple conversation system to demonstrate emphasized topic words. Note that a real conversation system would need to be much more robust and elaborate. We'll also create a variation on the exits verb to show our compassless exits.

	*: "The Gnome's Holiday"

	Include Keyword Interface by Aaron Reed. Use American dialect.

	Topic keyword highlighting is true. Parser highlighting is true. Keywords required is true.  

	After printing the banner text: say "First time players type ABOUT for more instructions.".

	Section - Conversation

	keyword-asking is an action applying to one thing. Understand "[a speakable]" as keyword-asking when the number of other people in location > 0.

	Carry out keyword-asking:
		let subject be a random other person in the location;
		say "[message of noun][paragraph break]".	
 
	A speakable is a kind of thing. A speakable has some text called the message. Instead of doing anything other than keyword-asking to a speakable: say "That's merely a topic of conversation.". Does the player mean doing something other than keyword-asking to a speakable: it is very unlikely.  

	Section - Exits

	Every room has some text called the exits text.

	First carry out listing exits: 
		unless the exits text of location is "":
			say the exits text of location;
			say line break;
		stop the action.

	After looking: try listing exits. 

	Section - Instructions

	Understand "about" as requesting the about text. Requesting the about text is an action out of world applying to nothing. Carry out requesting the about text: carry out the showing the keyword introduction text activity.

The lowered drawbridge spans the river to a treasure-strewn [d]wonderland[x][end if].". Understand "path" as west when location is Gnome's Garden. 

	A stone table is a keywordless fixed in place supporter in Gnome's Garden. On the table is a copy of the Daily Gnomon with description "You can't read gnomish, but you can make a great gnocchi."

It is east of Gnome's Garden and west of the Treasure-Strewn Wonderland. The description of drawbridge is "[if closed]If only you could find a way to lower it and cross the river![else]The treasure-strewn wonderland across the river awaits![end if]".

The description is "Looking closer, you see she is a beautiful baby dragon. She regards you [if we have keyword-asked the personality topic]with a friendly twinkle in her eye[else]fearfully, clutching the gnome's hat with an almost comically tight grip[end if]."  

	The dragon topic is a speakable with message "'You like her?' the gnome says fondly, petting the dragon which watches you nervously. 'She's named [t]Quinnabel[x].'".

	The Quinnabel topic is a speakable with message "'Found her in an old mushroom mine,' the gnome says, warming to his subject. The dragon sniffs you tentatively. 'She's got quite a [t]personality[x].'".

	The personality topic is a speakable with message "'Oh, she's shy at first, but she'll warm up to you right away if you let her.' And sure enough, the dragon finally seems to take a liking to you, and purrs contentedly as you scratch it behind the ears.". After keyword-asking the personality topic for the first time: say "'See, you're not such a bad sort,' the gnome says. 'Why don't you take this key and see to that drawbridge yourself.' And he hands you a scuffed silver key (oversized even for you)."; move silver key to player. The silver key unlocks the shack door.

	The drawbridge topic is a speakable with message "'Hrmph,' the gnome mutters, crossing his arms defiantly, 'I'm supposed to be on vacation.'".
