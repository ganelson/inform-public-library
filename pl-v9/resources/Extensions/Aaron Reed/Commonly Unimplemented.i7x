Chapter - Rules

Section - New Stripping Body Parts

body_part_words is an indexed text variable. body_part_words is "(~!|eye|head|skull|hair|nose|mouth|ear|cheek|forehead|face|neck|chest|gut|breast|belly|stomach|body|nipple|shoulder|collar|arm|wrist|hand|finger|knuckle|fingernail|waist|thigh|leg|knee|shin|ankle|foot|feet|toe|elbow|fist|thumb|tongue|lip|heart)~".

A smarter parser rule when sp_normal (this is the flexible stripping body parts rule):
	let last_word_pos be the number of words in reborn command;
	let last_word be indexed text;
	now last_word is word number last_word_pos in reborn command;
	if sp_regex last_word starts with body_part_words:
		identify error as flexible stripping body parts rule;
		replace word number last_word_pos in reborn command with "_body";
		if stripping "(on|in) ?(the|his|her|a|their|my)? _body" is fruitful or stripping "[apostrophe]?s _body" is fruitful, even within words: 
			identify error as flexible stripping body parts rule;
			reparse the command;
		else:
			reject the command.

Commonly Unimplemented ends here.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

An extension for Smarter Parser, this provides three new rules that offer tutorial-style messages if the player tries interacting with unimplemented body parts, clothing, or generic surroundings like the floor or ceiling.

Chapter: Customizing

Frequently you actually *will* implement some of these things, and want to avoid misleading your players if they're using the right word but an incorrect syntax. You can alter the messages to help teach players the correct format (see below) but you can also keep the extension from triggering at all by excluding specific words from the match list.

To do this, probably in a "when play begins" rule, you can use either of the phrase variants:

	release body part word "skull" from Smarter Parser
	release body part words {"skull", "head", "hair"} from Smarter Parser
	
...as well as four other phrases to "release clothing word(s)" and "release surroundings word(s)." This will also stop plurals from matching as well. You can see a list of the current words with:

	say body part words
	
And likewise for the other two categories.

Chapter: Rules

Section: the flexible stripping body parts rule

Looks for commands that reference parts of the body. If the reference is in the form of an addendum like ON HIS SHOULDER or IN THE FACE, strip the addendum and reparse. Also tries to reparse something like LOOK AT LISA'S FACE as LOOK AT LISA. If a body part word is found outside either of these patterns, reject the command.

The default list is:

	eye, head, skull, hair, nose, mouth, ear, cheek, forehead, face, neck, chest, gut, breast, belly, stomach, body, nipple, shoulder, collar, arm, wrist, hand, finger, knuckle, fingernail, waist, thigh, leg, knee, shin, ankle, foot, feet, toe, elbow, fist, thumb, tongue, lip, heart

	Stage is a room. Bob and Phil are people in Stage.
	A nose is a kind of thing. A nose is part of every person.
	
	Nose poking is an action applying to one thing. Understand "poke [something]" as nose poking. Check nose poking: if noun is not a nose, instead say "Only for noses!". Carry out nose poking: say "Strangely satisfying."
