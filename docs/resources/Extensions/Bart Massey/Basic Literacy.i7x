Chapter - Reading

[Bart: IMHO this should eventually rolled into the Standard Rules in some form. Having "read" be a synonym for "examine" is bizarre.]
A thing can be readable. A thing is rarely readable.
Reading is an action applying to one visible thing and requiring light.
Every thing has an indexed text called the read text. The read text is usually "".
Understand "read [thing]" as reading.

To say error (the thing read - a thing) has no read text (this is the say error no read text rule): say "[The thing read] has no text written on it."
Check an actor reading a thing (called the thing read) (this is the check reading a thing rule): if the read text of the thing read is empty, instead say "[error the thing read has no read text]" (A).
To say the read text of (the thing read - a thing) (this is the say the read text rule): Say "[command clarification break][read text of the thing read][paragraph break][command clarification break]".

Carry out an actor reading a thing (called the thing read) (this is the read rule): say "[the read text of the thing read]" (A).

Chapter - Writing

A thing can be writable. A thing is rarely writable.
A writing tool is a kind of thing.

To say error too many writables (this is say error several things to write on rule): say "There are several things to write on."
To say error no writables (this is the say error nothing to write on rule): say "There is nothing to write on."

Writing it on is an action applying to one topic and one touchable thing and requiring light. Understand "write [text]" or "write [text] on [thing]" as writing it on. Understand "write on [thing]" or "write [thing]" or "write" as a mistake ("You must specify what text you want to write.")

Rule for supplying a missing second noun when writing (this is the supply a writable thing rule): let N be the number of touchable writable things; if N is greater than one, instead say error too many writables; if N is zero, instead say error no writables; now the second noun is a random touchable writable thing.

To say error (T - a thing) is not for writing on (this is say error not for writing on rule): say "[The T] is not for writing on."
To say implicitly taking (T - a thing) (this is the say implicitly taking a thing for basic literacy rule): say "(taking [the T])[command clarification break]".
To say error missing writing tool: say "You need something to write with."

Before writing when the player does not carry a writing tool and a writing tool is touchable (this is the obtain a writing tool rule): let M be a random touchable writing tool; say implicitly taking M; silently try taking M.

Check an actor writing (this is the check writing rule): unless the second noun is writable, instead say "[error the second noun is not for writing on]"; unless the player carries a writing tool, instead say "[error missing writing tool]".

The text written is an indexed text which varies.

Carry out an actor writing (this is the carry out writing rule): let T be an indexed text; let T be the topic understood; now the text written is T; if the read text of the second noun is "",  now the read text of the second noun is T; otherwise now the read text of the second noun is "[read text of the second noun][paragraph break][T]".

Report writing (this is the report writing rule): say  "You write on [the second noun]."


Chapter - Erasing

A thing can be erasable. An erasing tool is a kind of thing. 
To say error too many erasables (this is the say error several erasables rule): say "There are several things to erase."
To say error no erasables (this is the say error no erasables rule): say "There is nothing to erase."
Erasing is an action applying to one touchable thing and requiring light. Understand "erase" or "erase [thing]" as erasing.

Rule for supplying a missing noun when erasing (this is the choose an erasable rule): let N be the number of touchable writable things; if N is greater than one, instead say error too many erasables; if N is zero, instead say error no erasables; now the noun is a random touchable writable thing.

To say error (T - a thing) need not be erased (this is the say error no writing rule): say "There is no writing on [the T] to erase."
To say error (T - a thing) cannot be erased (this is the say error not erasable rule): say "[The T] is not erasable."
To say error no erasing tool (this is the say error no erasing tool rule): say "You need something to erase with."
To say error failed to obtain an erasing tool (this is the say error failed to obtain an erasing tool rule): say "You fail to find anything usable to erase with."

Before erasing when the player does not carry an erasing tool and an erasing tool is touchable (this is the obtain an erasing tool rule):
	repeat with E running through touchable erasing tools:
		say implicitly taking E;
		silently try taking E;
		if rule succeeded:
			continue the action;
	say error failed to obtain an erasing tool;
	rule fails.

Check an actor erasing (this is the check erasing rule): unless the noun is erasable, instead say "[error the noun cannot be erased]" (A); unless the read text of the noun is not empty, instead say "[error the noun need not be erased]" (B); unless the player carries an erasing tool, instead say "[error no erasing tool]" (C).

Carry out an actor erasing (this is the carry out erasing rule): now the read text of the noun is "" (A).
Report erasing (this is the report erasing rule): say "You erase [the noun]."

Basic Literacy ends here.

---- Documentation ----
This module extends Inform 7 by providing some basic actions and types that allow the player to read, write and erase text. This is implemented by giving every thing an indexed text called the "read text". With this module loaded, the "read" command no longer invokes the "examining" action. Instead, "read [thing]" shows the read text of the thing read.
Allowing the player to write arbitrary text on things is also allowed. The thing to be written on must have the "writable" property, and the player must have access to a "writing tool". Subsequent writes will append new paragraphs to the read text of the thing written.
Allowing the player to erase the text on things is also allowed. The thing to be erased on must have the "erasable" property, and the player must have access to an "erasing tool". A writable thing is also erasable unless stated otherwise. 
Writable-Erasable things: A notebook, a whiteboard, a graffiti
Writable-only things: An engraving, a legal document.

Example: * OLAB - A writable erasable thing 
	
	*: "OLAB" by "Bart Massey"
	
	Include Basic Literacy by Bart Massey
	
	The OLAB is a room. "This room is bare except for a whiteboard mounted on one wall."
	The whiteboard is writable erasable scenery in the OLAB. The description is "A regulation-issue whiteboard with a metal tray.[if read text of the whiteboard is not empty] [the contents of the whiteboard][end if]". The read text is "SCRIBBLE ON ME". Understand "board" as the whiteboard. Understand "scribble [text] on [whiteboard]" as writing it on.
	
	To say the contents of the whiteboard: say "Scribbled on the whiteboard is:"; silently try reading the whiteboard.
	
	The metal tray is a supporter. It is part of the whiteboard. The description is "This narrow metal tray is built to support markers and erasers."
	
	A marker is a kind of writing tool. A marker cap is a kind of thing. The description of a marker cap is usually "This cap keeps the marker from drying up." A marker cap is part of every marker. Does the player mean doing something with the marker cap: it is unlikely. Instead of doing something other than examining with the marker cap: say "There is no need to fiddle with the marker cap."
	
	The black marker is a marker on the metal tray. The description is "This is as generic a whiteboard marker as you'll ever hope to find. It has a black cap."  
	
	Report writing it on (this is the detailed report writing rule): say "You take the cap off the marker, write on [the second noun], and replace the cap carefully." The detailed report writing rule is listed instead of the report writing rule in the report writing it on rulebook.
	
	An eraser is an erasing tool on the metal tray. The description is "A classic fuzzy whiteboard eraser, none too clean."
	Test me with "read whiteboard / erase whiteboard / read whiteboard".
	
Example: * The Poet's Notebook - A writable non erasable thing
	
	*: "The Poet's Notebook" by "Andre Rodriguez"
	
	Include Basic Literacy by Bart Massey

	When play begins: say "The Poet's bedroom is place where vulnerability and fragile emotions are encouraged. (Once you write something in his notebook, it is there for all eternity)."

	The Poet's Bedroom is a room. "This is where the Poet sits down to think and reflect upon existence."
	The desk is a fixed in place supporter in the Poet's Bedroom.
	The Poet's Notebook is writable scenery on the desk. The description is "A notebook to transform thoughts and feelings into words. [if read text of the Poet's Notebook is not empty] [read text][end if]". Understand "notebook" as the Poet's Notebook.

	To say the contents of the notebook: say "The notebook reads:"; silently try reading the notebook.
	A writing tool called a pen is on the desk. The description is "A regular pen. Many stories have been written with this old friend."
	White Ink is an erasing tool on the desk. The description is "Could this white ink erase something written on the notebook?"
	Check an actor erasing the notebook  (this is the check erasing notebook rule): say "Not a chance, once you write something here there's no going back."
