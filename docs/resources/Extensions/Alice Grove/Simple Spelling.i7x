Version 2/160807 of Simple Spelling by Alice Grove begins here.

"Simple Spelling aims to make stories more screen-reader-friendly by allowing players to request the spelling of any visible thing. This extension adds two actions: 'listing visible items for spelling' and 'spelling the numbered word.'"


Section - Introduction

introduce simple spelling features is a truth state that varies. introduce simple spelling features is usually true. 

When play begins (this is the introduce the simple spelling features rule):
	if introduce simple spelling features is true:
		say "Are you using a screen reader? (Y/N)>[run paragraph on]" (A);
		if player consents:
			say "[line break]This story allows you to request the spelling of nearby things. For a list of nearby items that can be spelled, please type the word SPELL. Each time you do this, a new numbered list will be generated.[paragraph break]To request the spelling of an item, please type the word SPELL followed by the item's number on the list." (B);
		say line break.


Section - Spelling Reference Number Property

A thing has a number called a spelling reference number.


Section - Phrases for Making a New Spelling List

To clear all spelling reference numbers:
	repeat with item running through things:
		now the spelling reference number of the item is 0.

		
inspect simple spelling list for duplicates is a truth state that varies. Inspect simple spelling list for duplicates is usually true.

To decide which list of things is the new spelling list:
	let brand-new spelling list be a list of things;
	if inspect simple spelling list for duplicates is true:
		let unique item names be a list of texts;
		repeat with current item running through visible things:
			let current name be the printed name of the current item;
			if the current name is not listed in the unique item names:
				add the current item to the brand-new spelling list;
				add the current name to the unique item names;
	otherwise:
		repeat with current item running through visible things:
			add the current item to the brand-new spelling list;
	decide on the brand-new spelling list.


Section - Listing Visible Items

Listing visible items for spelling is an action out of world.
Understand "spell" as listing visible items for spelling.

Check listing visible items for spelling (this is the make sure there is at least one visible item to put on the spelling list rule):
	if there is a visible thing:
		continue the action;
	otherwise:
		say "There are no nearby items to spell." (A) instead.

Carry out listing visible items for spelling (this is the list the visible items and their spelling reference numbers rule):
	clear all spelling reference numbers;
	let spelling list be the new spelling list;
	let total spelling entries be the number of entries in the spelling list;
	if the total spelling entries > 1:
		say "To spell the name of something, please type the word SPELL followed by a number from 1 to [total spelling entries]." (A);
		let N be 0;
		repeat with item running through spelling list:
			increment N;
			now the spelling reference number of item is N;
			let current name be the printed name of item;
			say "To spell [current name in upper case], type [spelling reference number of item]." (B);
	otherwise if the total spelling entries is 1:
		let lone item be entry 1 in the spelling list;
		now the spelling reference number of the lone item is 1;
		say "You can see only [printed name of lone item]." (C);
		try spelling the numbered word 1.
		

Section - Spelling a Word

Spelling the numbered word is an action out of world applying to one number.
Understand "spell [number]" as spelling the numbered word.

[When the player generates a numbered list of nearby things, that list will always begin with the number 1. The number 0 is used internally only; it designates items that are not on the list. So the command SPELL 0 would likely only be entered by mistake. Rather than confusing the player by spelling a series of items assigned the number 0, we block the action.]
Check spelling the numbered word when the number understood is 0 (this is the can't spell words with a spelling number of zero rule):
	say "The number 0 is not one of the options on the list of nearby things. To list nearby things and their numbers, please type the word SPELL." (A) instead.

Check spelling the numbered word (this is the make sure there is a visible item with the given spelling number rule):
	repeat with visible item running through visible things:
		if the spelling reference number of the visible item is the number understood:
			continue the action;
	say "There are no nearby things assigned the number [number understood]. To list nearby things and their numbers, please type the word SPELL." (A) instead.

Carry out spelling the numbered word (this is the spell the word that has the given spelling number rule):
	repeat with visible item running through visible things:
		if the spelling reference number of the visible item is the number understood:
			let current name be the printed name of the visible item;
			say "[Current name in upper case] is spelled[run paragraph on]" (A);
			repeat with N running from 1 to  the number of characters in current name:
				say " " (B);
				let current letter be character number N in current name;
				if the current letter is " ":
					say "space" (C);
				otherwise if the current letter is "-":
					say "hyphen" (D);
				otherwise if the current letter is "[']":
					say "apostrophe" (E);
				otherwise if the current letter is ".":
					say "[if American dialect option is active]period[otherwise]full stop[end if]" (F);
				otherwise:
					say the current letter in upper case;
			say "." (G).

---- DOCUMENTATION ---- 

Thanks to Neil Butters for the code feedback!

Section: Basic Use

Punctuation, words that sound like other words, and made-up words aren't always clear when spoken by a screen reader. Nevertheless, parser IF requires players to spell the names of things in order to refer to them. This extension aims to make stories more screen-reader-friendly by allowing players to request the spelling of any visible thing.

This extension adds two actions:  "listing visible items for spelling" and "spelling the numbered word."

The command SPELL leads to the "listing visible items for spelling" action. This action will automatically display a list of visible things, numbering them for the player's reference. This list is made only after clearing any numbers that have previously been assigned to things in the story.

To request the spelling of an item, the player can then type SPELL followed by the item's number on the list.


Section: Options

By default, players will be asked at the start of play if they are using a screen reader. Then if the player answers YES, the spelling features will be briefly explained. To turn off this opening question and introduction (for instance, if we want to introduce the spelling features elsewhere) we can set "introduce simple spelling features" to "false":

	*: introduce simple spelling features is false.
	
If we do want the question and introduction, but only in a released version of the story, we can put the above code in a section marked "Not for release":

	*:
	Section - Introducing spelling features - Not for release
	
	introduce simple spelling features is false.

By default, this extension will check for duplicates when making a spelling list so as not to include the same entry twice. This is helpful if we have duplicate items in our story and want to avoid, for instance, listing twenty identical coins as twenty separate items on the list. If we want to skip the check-for-duplicates step, we can set "inspect simple spelling list for duplicates" to "false":

	*: inspect simple spelling list for duplicates is false.
