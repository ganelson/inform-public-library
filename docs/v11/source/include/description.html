			<p>This is a public library of extensions shared by Inform authors. They're all published under a
			Creative Commons Attribution licence, which means you can use them for free in any project of your own.
			(Inform will automatically take care of crediting the authors.)</p>
			<p>This version of the library is intended for projects using version 11
			of Inform. It is <b>experimental and for now exists only for testing the Inform apps ahead of the v11 release</b>.
			As such, it contains only a handful of extensions, but in their modernised file format.</p>
