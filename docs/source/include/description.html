			<p>This is a public library of extensions shared by Inform authors. They're all published under a
			Creative Commons Attribution licence, which means you can use them for free in any project of your own.
			(Inform will automatically take care of crediting the authors.)</p>
			<p>This version of the library is intended for projects using version 10
			of Inform. More extensions and newer versions of some extensions here may
			be found at the <a href="https://github.com/i7/extensions/tree/10.1">Friends of I7 Extensions 10.1 branch</a>.
			Extensions compatible with Inform version 9.3 (6M62) can be found at the
			<a href="https://github.com/i7/extensions/tree/9.3">Friends of I7
			Extensions 9.3 branch</a>. Most of these will also work with 9.1 (6L02)
			or 9.2 (6L38), but if you need an older version of an extension, consult
			the git history of the
			<a href="https://github.com/i7/extensions/tree/master">Friends of I7 Extensions master branch</a>.</p>
			<p>At some point we hope to replace this form of the library with
			a more version-aware one, able to install multiple versions as needed.
			In the mean time, if you need a different version of an extension just
			for one project, you can install it in that project's X.materials/Extensions
			directory. Or if you need to uninstall a version of an extension you've
			installed with the buttons below, your app should provide a menu item
			to bring up the directory in your file-system Finder or Explorer.</p>
			<p>You can review or discuss extensions (other than the built-in ones) at the
			Interactive Fiction Forum using the links provided. If you'd like to suggest future
			extensions, or talk about general questions to do with extensions, please
			<a href='http://www.intfiction.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=45&t=13409'>click here instead<a>
			to get to the topic provided for that.</p>
